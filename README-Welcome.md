Welcome to Blockparty!

The idea here is to show a simple app using blockchain via Nuls to record transactions among neighbors so they can trade goods and services.

In this example, there are nine people registered to trades food item like apples, oranges and eggs. Each item costs one nuls or one "token". 

The app can be expanded to do things like trade food for services. One-half hour of house cleaning might be worth 5 eggs, 2 apples and a loaf of bread.
Driving a neighbor to the airport might win you 6 avocados and an hour of babysitting.  And so on.

The app started with a copy of Nuls Chainbox example. I modified the html front-end to accept food trading.
